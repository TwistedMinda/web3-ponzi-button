- [ponzi-button.on.fleek.co](ponzi-button.on.fleek.co) (Decentralized)

### Goal

The goal is to create a Meme [Ponzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme) that will benefit to a maximum of people while minimizing the loss for the late-comers, as well as incentivizing non-gamblers.

Ponzi Button features:

- ultra-cheap enty price (10 FTM)
- absolutely no fees
- easy-to-understand interface
- no shady token that could lose value (except for FTM)
- non-upgradable contract (no owner)
- transparent information about the current Ponzi state

### Rules

Entry price: Pressing the button is and always will be 10 FTM.

- You first press the button for 10 FTM
- Your 10 FTM paid are divided equally to the previous tappers
- You then earn rewards every time the button is pressed by anyone

Your rewards are calculated like this:

1. Tap Value = 10 FTM / [Total Taps - 1]
2. Next Rewards = [Tap Value] x [Your taps]

**Note**: Your rewards can be claimed whenever you want, forever.

### Contract

Check the contract code:

### Just a Meme experiment

I won't be responsible for you losing money while using my contract!
But don't hesitate to post an issue if needed.

Other experiments are coming...
